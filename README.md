# Data Profession Survey 

### Project Overview
The project focuses on analyzing voter demographics and career trends. In this study, we delve into various aspects including voter demographics such as age, job titles, industry type, and country of residence. Additionally, we explore respondents' favorite programming languages and investigate career transitions. Through meticulous data collection and analysis, we aim to uncover valuable insights into the intersections between voter characteristics and career trajectories, shedding light on the evolving landscape of our electorate and workforce.

### Tools
- Excel
- Power BI

### Data Cleaning
The data has been refined by eliminating empty columns and standardizing the representation of average salaries. Previously, salary ranges like "10k-53k" have been transformed into single values, such as "31.5," and recorded in a new column for consistency and ease of analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
 1. What is the total number of survey participants who are voters?
 2. What is the midpoint age of the voters?
 3. Which are the primary five countries to which the voters are affiliated?
 4. What are the occupations held by the voters?
 5. Which programming language do the voters prefer the most?
 6. How are job titles distributed across various industries?
 7. What is the count of voters who have transitioned careers at some point in their lives?
